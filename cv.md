## Projects

- **Full-Stack E-Commerce Website**
    _Tech: React, Node.js, MySQL, Express.js, SSLCommerz_
    Developed a complete e-commerce platform with product listing, cart, and checkout. Integrated
    SSLCommerz for secure online payments. Designed REST APIs and managed backend using Express
    and MySQL.
    
- **Social Media Web App**
    _Tech: React, Appwrite, Appwrite Database_
    Built a social media platform with user authentication, post creation, and real-time feeds. Used
    Appwrite as a backend-as-a-service for auth, storage, and database. Implemented responsive UI and
    state management with React.
    
- **Real-Time Messaging App**
    _Tech: React, Node.js, Socket.io, MongoDB_
    Developed a real-time chat app with one-on-one messaging functionality. Used Socket.io for real-time
    WebSocket communication. Stored messages and user data in MongoDB.
    
- **Diffusion Model Fine-tuning (DDPM)**
    _Tech: PyTorch, Hugging Face Diffusers, DDPM/DDIM, torchvision_
    Fine-tuned a pretrained DDPM UNet (CelebA-HQ 256) on a custom butterflies dataset using Hugging 
    Face Diffusers. Implemented DDIM sampling for faster inference, gradient accumulation for memory 
    efficiency, and MSE noise-prediction training. Applied torchvision v2 transforms for preprocessing 
    and generated samples across epochs to track quality improvements.
    
- **DCGAN Face Generation (CelebA)**
    _Tech: PyTorch, GANs, Deep Convolutional Networks_
    Built a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network to generate photorealistic celebrity faces 
    using 200k+ aligned face images. Implemented adversarial training with Generator/Discriminator 
    architecture, handled mode collapse and training instability issues. Applied batch normalization, 
    LeakyReLU activations, and proper weight initialization for stable convergence.
    
- **Video Action Recognition (UCF101)**
    _Tech: PyTorch, R(2+1)D CNN, OpenCV, 3D Convolutions_
    Implemented spatiotemporal CNN architecture for video classification using R(2+1)D model on UCF101 
    dataset. Designed custom video data pipeline with temporal sampling, frame extraction, and uniform 
    padding. Applied transfer learning with pretrained Kinetics-400 weights and achieved action recognition 
    across multiple human activity categories with class-weighted loss for imbalanced data.
    
- **Heart Disease Prediction System**
    _Tech: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib_
    Built multiple classification models to predict heart disease risk using 13 clinical features from 303 
    patients. Performed comprehensive EDA with correlation analysis and feature visualization. Compared 
    algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting. Achieved 85-90% 
    accuracy with proper cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
